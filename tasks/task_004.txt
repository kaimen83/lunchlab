# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Storage Location Management UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build UI components for managing storage locations in the settings page
# Details:
Create StorageLocationManager and StorageLocationForm components. Add a 'Storage Locations' section to the settings page. Implement a table view of locations with columns for name, type, status, and creation date. Build a modal form for adding and editing locations. Include confirmation dialog for deletion. Add status toggle functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all CRUD operations work through the UI. Test form validation for required fields. Check responsive design on different screen sizes. Test accessibility compliance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Base StorageLocationManager Component with Data Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the main container component that handles data fetching, state management, and API integration for storage locations. This component will serve as the foundation for all storage location operations.
### Details:
Implement StorageLocationManager as a container component following the Container/Presentational pattern. Set up state management using React hooks (useState, useEffect) or a state management library like Zustand. Create API service functions for CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using Axios or fetch API. Implement error handling with try-catch blocks and error boundaries. Add loading states and optimistic updates for better UX. Include data validation and sanitization. Structure the component to manage: locations array, loading states, error states, selected location for editing, and modal visibility states. Add proper TypeScript interfaces for storage location data structure including id, name, type, status, creationDate, and any additional metadata.

## 2. Build StorageLocationForm Component with Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a reusable form component for adding and editing storage locations with comprehensive validation, accessibility features, and responsive design.
### Details:
Develop StorageLocationForm using React Hook Form or Formik for form state management and validation. Implement form fields for: name (required, text input), type (required, select dropdown with predefined options), status (toggle/switch), and any additional metadata fields. Add client-side validation with real-time feedback using validation schemas (Yup or Zod). Ensure WCAG compliance with proper ARIA labels, error announcements, and keyboard navigation. Make the form responsive using CSS Grid/Flexbox or UI framework grid system. Include form submission handling with loading states and error display. Add form reset functionality and proper default values for edit mode. Implement field-level validation with clear error messages and visual indicators. Support both create and edit modes by accepting initialData prop.

## 3. Implement Storage Locations Data Table with Sorting and Filtering [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Build a comprehensive data table component to display storage locations with advanced features like sorting, filtering, search, and action buttons for each row.
### Details:
Create a data table using Material-UI DataGrid, Ant Design Table, or a custom table implementation. Configure columns for: name, type, status (with visual indicators like badges or chips), creation date (formatted), and actions column with edit/delete buttons. Implement sorting functionality for all columns with proper data type handling (string, date, enum). Add search/filter capabilities with a search input that filters across multiple columns. Include status filtering with dropdown or toggle options. Add pagination for large datasets with configurable page sizes. Implement row selection for bulk operations if needed. Use proper loading states with skeleton loaders or spinners. Add empty state handling with appropriate messaging and call-to-action. Ensure mobile responsiveness with horizontal scrolling or responsive column hiding. Include accessibility features like keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

## 4. Create Modal System with Confirmation Dialogs [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement a modal system for housing the storage location form and confirmation dialogs for delete operations, with proper focus management and accessibility.
### Details:
Build a modal component using Material-UI Dialog, Headless UI, or custom modal implementation. Create two modal types: StorageLocationModal (for create/edit form) and ConfirmationDialog (for delete operations). Implement proper modal behavior: focus trapping, escape key handling, backdrop click to close, and proper z-index management. Add smooth animations for modal open/close transitions. Ensure accessibility with proper ARIA attributes, focus management, and screen reader announcements. Create the confirmation dialog with clear messaging, action buttons (confirm/cancel), and loading states during deletion. Implement modal state management in the parent component with proper cleanup. Add responsive design for mobile devices with full-screen modals on small screens. Include proper error handling within modals and success feedback after operations. Support keyboard navigation and ensure modals are properly announced to assistive technologies.

## 5. Integrate Components and Add to Settings Page with Status Toggle [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Integrate all storage location components into the settings page, implement status toggle functionality, and add comprehensive testing and error handling.
### Details:
Create a 'Storage Locations' section in the settings page that incorporates the StorageLocationManager component. Implement status toggle functionality with immediate visual feedback and API synchronization. Add proper section headers, descriptions, and help text for user guidance. Implement comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error messages and retry mechanisms. Add success notifications for all CRUD operations using toast notifications or snackbars. Create loading states for the entire section during initial data fetch. Implement proper component composition with clear separation of concerns. Add comprehensive testing including unit tests for individual components, integration tests for component interactions, and end-to-end tests for complete user workflows. Ensure proper cleanup of event listeners and API calls on component unmount. Add proper TypeScript types throughout the component hierarchy. Implement proper security measures including input sanitization and authorization checks. Add analytics tracking for user interactions if required. Ensure the entire feature works seamlessly across different browsers and devices.
