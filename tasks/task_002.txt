# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Data Migration Strategy
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create and execute a migration plan to move existing inventory data to the new multi-location structure
# Details:
Implement the migrate_existing_stock_to_default_location() function as specified in the PRD. Create a default warehouse location for each company. Update all existing stock items to reference this default location. Include validation to ensure no data is lost during migration. Implement rollback capability in case of migration failure.

# Test Strategy:
Run migration in a test environment first. Verify count of items before and after migration matches. Check that all items have a valid location_id after migration. Test rollback functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Conduct Comprehensive Data Audit and Schema Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform a thorough audit of existing inventory data to identify inconsistencies, duplicates, and structural issues. Analyze the current single-location schema and design the mapping strategy to the new multi-location structure.
### Details:
Implementation steps: 1) Query existing inventory tables to generate data quality reports (record counts, null values, duplicates, data type inconsistencies). 2) Create data profiling scripts using pandas/SQL to identify edge cases and anomalies. 3) Document current schema structure and create detailed field mapping from single-location to multi-location format. 4) Identify all foreign key relationships and dependencies that will be affected. 5) Generate a comprehensive audit report with findings and recommendations. Testing: Create automated data quality checks using SQL queries to validate findings. Use tools like Great Expectations for systematic data validation rules.

## 2. Design Migration Architecture and Create Default Warehouse Locations [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Design the ETL pipeline architecture and create default warehouse locations for each company. Implement the core infrastructure needed for the migration process including backup and rollback mechanisms.
### Details:
Implementation steps: 1) Design ETL pipeline using SQLAlchemy and pandas for data extraction, transformation, and loading. 2) Create migrate_existing_stock_to_default_location() function skeleton with proper error handling and logging. 3) Implement create_default_warehouse_per_company() function to generate default locations. 4) Set up backup tables and transaction management for rollback capability. 5) Create migration state tracking table to monitor progress. 6) Implement comprehensive logging system for audit trail. Testing: Unit test each function with mock data. Test transaction rollback scenarios. Validate default warehouse creation logic with sample companies.

## 3. Implement Data Transformation and Validation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Build the core transformation logic to convert single-location inventory records to multi-location format. Implement comprehensive validation rules to ensure data integrity during migration.
### Details:
Implementation steps: 1) Implement data transformation functions that map existing inventory items to default warehouse locations. 2) Create validation rules to check data consistency (foreign key integrity, quantity validation, duplicate detection). 3) Build reconciliation logic to compare pre and post-migration data counts and totals. 4) Implement data quality checks using automated validation frameworks. 5) Create detailed transformation logging to track each record's migration status. 6) Add data type conversion and formatting standardization. Testing: Test transformation logic with various data scenarios including edge cases. Validate all business rules are preserved. Test with subset of production data to verify accuracy.

## 4. Execute Phased Migration with Real-time Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Execute the migration in controlled phases with real-time monitoring, progress tracking, and immediate validation at each step. Implement automated rollback triggers for failure scenarios.
### Details:
Implementation steps: 1) Implement phased migration approach, processing data in batches to minimize risk and allow incremental validation. 2) Create real-time monitoring dashboard to track migration progress, error rates, and performance metrics. 3) Implement automated checkpoint system that validates data integrity after each batch. 4) Build automatic rollback triggers that activate when validation thresholds are exceeded. 5) Create detailed progress reporting with estimated completion times. 6) Implement pause/resume functionality for controlled migration execution. Testing: Test migration with progressively larger data sets. Validate monitoring accuracy and rollback functionality. Test failure scenarios and recovery procedures.

## 5. Post-Migration Validation and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Perform comprehensive post-migration validation to ensure data integrity and completeness. Create detailed documentation and establish ongoing monitoring for the new multi-location system.
### Details:
Implementation steps: 1) Execute comprehensive data reconciliation comparing pre and post-migration datasets (record counts, sum totals, key relationships). 2) Run automated validation suite to verify all business rules and constraints are maintained. 3) Perform sample data verification by manually checking representative records. 4) Create detailed migration report documenting process, results, and any issues encountered. 5) Establish ongoing data quality monitoring for the new multi-location structure. 6) Document rollback procedures and create runbooks for future reference. 7) Archive migration logs and backup data according to retention policies. Testing: Validate all inventory operations work correctly in the new multi-location structure. Test system performance with migrated data. Verify reporting and analytics functions produce expected results.
