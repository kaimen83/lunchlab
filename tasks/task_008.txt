# Task ID: 8
# Title: Build Stock Transfer UI Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create UI for initiating and managing inventory transfers
# Details:
Implement StockTransferForm and StockTransferTable components. Create LocationSelector component for source and destination selection. Add a new 'Inventory Transfer' tab to the main navigation. Build UI for viewing transfer history with filtering options. Implement real-time validation of transfer quantities. Add status indicators for transfer workflow states.

# Test Strategy:
Test the complete transfer workflow from initiation to completion. Verify form validation prevents invalid transfers. Test filtering and sorting of transfer history. Check that UI updates correctly after transfers are completed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create LocationSelector Component with Real-time Data Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a reusable LocationSelector component that provides dynamic source and destination location selection with real-time inventory data. This component will serve as the foundation for all transfer operations and must handle location filtering, validation, and display current stock levels.
### Details:
Implement using React with TypeScript and Material UI Select components. Create a controlled component that accepts props for available locations, current selection, and onChange handlers. Integrate with backend APIs to fetch real-time location data and inventory levels. Include validation to prevent selecting the same location for source and destination. Add loading states and error handling for API calls. Implement search/filter functionality for large location lists. Use the Container/Presentational pattern to separate data fetching logic from UI rendering. Include accessibility features like keyboard navigation and screen reader support. Test with mock data and various location scenarios including empty states.

## 2. Implement StockTransferForm with Real-time Validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive form component for initiating stock transfers with real-time validation, quantity checks, and optimistic UI updates. The form must validate transfer quantities against available stock and provide immediate feedback to users.
### Details:
Build using React Hook Form for robust form handling and validation. Integrate the LocationSelector component from subtask 1. Implement real-time validation that checks available stock quantities as users type, preventing transfers that would result in negative inventory. Use debounced API calls to validate quantities without overwhelming the server. Include item selection with search and filtering capabilities, showing current stock levels for each item at the source location. Add barcode scanning support using QuaggaJS library. Implement form state management with clear error messages and success feedback. Use Material UI components for consistent styling. Add form persistence to prevent data loss on accidental navigation. Include unit tests for validation logic and form submission scenarios.

## 3. Build StockTransferTable with Status Indicators and Workflow Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Develop a data table component to display transfer records with status indicators, workflow state management, and action buttons. The table must support the complete transfer lifecycle from draft to completion with clear visual status indicators.
### Details:
Create using Material UI DataGrid or Table components with custom status indicator cells. Implement state machine pattern using XState to model transfer workflow states (draft, pending, in-transit, completed, cancelled). Design status indicators with color coding and icons for immediate visual recognition. Add action buttons for each transfer state (approve, cancel, complete) with appropriate permissions. Include sorting, filtering, and pagination for large datasets. Implement optimistic UI updates for status changes with rollback on failure. Add bulk actions for managing multiple transfers simultaneously. Include export functionality for transfer reports. Use Command pattern for transfer actions to enable undo/redo and audit logging. Test with various transfer states and edge cases including network failures.

## 4. Create Transfer History View with Advanced Filtering and Search [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Build a comprehensive transfer history interface with advanced filtering, search capabilities, and detailed transfer information display. This view must provide users with powerful tools to track and analyze transfer patterns and performance.
### Details:
Implement using React Query for efficient data fetching and caching. Create advanced filter components for date ranges, locations, items, status, and users. Add full-text search across transfer details including notes and item descriptions. Build expandable row details showing complete transfer information including timestamps, user actions, and item specifics. Implement virtual scrolling for performance with large datasets. Add data visualization components showing transfer trends and statistics. Include export functionality for filtered results in CSV/Excel formats. Use URL state management to make filters shareable and bookmarkable. Add saved filter presets for common queries. Implement real-time updates using WebSocket connections for live transfer status changes. Test with large datasets and various filter combinations.

## 5. Integrate Navigation Tab and Orchestrate Complete Transfer Workflow [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Add the 'Inventory Transfer' navigation tab and integrate all components into a cohesive workflow experience. This final step ensures seamless user experience across all transfer operations with proper state management and error handling.
### Details:
Add new navigation tab to the main application navigation using the existing navigation component structure. Create a main Transfer page component that orchestrates all previously built components (StockTransferForm, StockTransferTable, Transfer History). Implement Redux Toolkit or React Query for global state management of transfer data. Add breadcrumb navigation and page routing for different transfer views. Implement comprehensive error boundaries and loading states across all components. Add notification system for transfer status updates using toast notifications. Create user onboarding flow with guided tour for first-time users. Implement keyboard shortcuts for power users (Ctrl+N for new transfer, etc.). Add responsive design breakpoints for mobile and tablet usage. Include comprehensive integration tests covering the complete transfer workflow from initiation to completion. Set up monitoring and analytics tracking for user interactions and performance metrics.
