# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Matrix View for Cross-location Comparison
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a matrix view showing inventory items across all locations
# Details:
Build StockMatrixView component with items as rows and locations as columns. Implement color coding based on quantity levels. Add horizontal scrolling for many locations. Create toggle between standard and matrix views. Implement sorting and filtering options specific to the matrix view.

# Test Strategy:
Test matrix view with various numbers of items and locations. Verify color coding works correctly. Test sorting and filtering functionality. Check performance with large datasets. Verify responsive behavior.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create StockMatrixView Component with Data Structure and Basic Grid [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the foundational StockMatrixView component with proper data modeling where items are rows and locations are columns. Implement efficient data retrieval and transformation using the Model-View-ViewModel pattern to separate data logic from UI concerns.
### Details:
Create a React component that fetches inventory data via API and transforms it into matrix format using a data mapper pattern. Implement the component structure with items as rows and locations as columns. Use React Table or AG Grid for the base grid functionality. Create data transformation utilities to convert flat inventory data into matrix format (similar to pandas pivot). Implement proper state management for matrix data using React hooks. Add loading states and error handling for data fetching. Structure the component to support future enhancements like virtualization for large datasets. Include proper TypeScript interfaces for type safety.

## 2. Implement Color Coding System Based on Quantity Levels [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Add visual indicators through color coding to represent different quantity levels (low stock, adequate, overstock) using CSS-in-JS or styled-components. Implement configurable thresholds and ensure accessibility compliance with ARIA guidelines.
### Details:
Create a color coding system that dynamically applies background colors to cells based on quantity thresholds (e.g., red for low stock, yellow for medium, green for adequate). Implement configurable threshold settings that can be adjusted per item or globally. Use CSS custom properties or styled-components for maintainable styling. Ensure accessibility by adding ARIA labels and using color combinations that meet WCAG contrast requirements. Add a legend component to explain the color coding system. Implement hover states and tooltips to show exact quantities and threshold information. Consider colorblind-friendly palette options. Use semantic CSS classes for easier testing and maintenance.

## 3. Add Horizontal Scrolling and View Toggle Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Implement responsive horizontal scrolling for matrices with many locations using virtualization techniques. Create a toggle mechanism to switch between standard list view and matrix view, ensuring smooth transitions and state preservation.
### Details:
Implement horizontal scrolling using CSS overflow-x with sticky first column (item names) for better UX. Add virtualization using react-virtualized or similar library to handle large numbers of locations efficiently. Create a view toggle component with clear visual indicators (icons/labels) for standard vs matrix views. Implement state management to preserve user selections (filters, sorting) when switching views. Add keyboard navigation support for accessibility (arrow keys, tab navigation). Ensure the matrix remains responsive on different screen sizes with appropriate breakpoints. Implement smooth transitions between views using CSS animations. Add scroll position persistence when switching between views. Include loading indicators during view transitions.

## 4. Implement Matrix-Specific Sorting and Filtering Options [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3
### Description: Add comprehensive sorting and filtering capabilities optimized for matrix view, including multi-column sorting, location-based filters, and quantity range filters. Implement search functionality and filter persistence using the Observer pattern for real-time updates.
### Details:
Implement multi-dimensional sorting options: by item name, total quantity across locations, specific location quantities, or variance between locations. Add filtering controls including: item name search, location selection (multi-select dropdown), quantity range sliders, and stock level filters (low/adequate/overstock). Create a filter panel that can be collapsed/expanded for better space utilization. Use debounced search inputs to optimize performance. Implement filter persistence in URL parameters or local storage for bookmarkable states. Add clear all filters functionality and active filter indicators. Use the Observer pattern to update the matrix in real-time when filters change. Implement export functionality for filtered results. Add keyboard shortcuts for common filter operations. Include filter presets for common scenarios (e.g., 'Low Stock Items', 'High Variance Locations').
