# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Stock Transfer API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create API endpoints for managing inventory transfers between locations
# Details:
Implement POST and GET endpoints for /api/companies/[id]/stock/transfers. Create PUT endpoint for /api/companies/[id]/stock/transfers/[transferId]/approve. Add transaction support to ensure data consistency during transfers. Implement validation to prevent transfers exceeding available quantity. Add logic to update stock quantities in both source and destination locations.

# Test Strategy:
Test transfer creation with valid and invalid data. Verify stock quantities are correctly updated after transfers. Test concurrent transfers to ensure data consistency. Verify approval workflow functions correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design API Schema and Database Models for Stock Transfers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational data models and API schema for stock transfers, incorporating proper validation rules and database constraints. This includes defining the transfer entity structure, status workflow, and relationship mappings between companies, locations, and inventory items.
### Details:
Implement database models for StockTransfer entity with fields: id, companyId, sourceLocationId, destinationLocationId, items (array of {itemId, quantity, unitPrice}), status (pending/approved/completed/cancelled), requestedBy, approvedBy, createdAt, updatedAt. Create database constraints for foreign keys and check constraints for positive quantities. Define API schema using OpenAPI/Swagger specification with proper validation rules (required fields, data types, quantity limits). Implement status enum with clear state transitions. Add indexes on companyId, status, and createdAt for query performance. Test with database migration scripts and schema validation.

## 2. Implement POST Endpoint for Creating Stock Transfer Requests [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create the POST /api/companies/[id]/stock/transfers endpoint with comprehensive validation, authentication, and initial business logic checks. This endpoint initiates transfer requests and performs preliminary validation without executing the actual inventory movement.
### Details:
Implement POST endpoint with JWT authentication and role-based authorization (require 'inventory_manager' or higher role). Add request validation using Joi/Yup schema: validate company ownership, source/destination location existence, item availability, and positive quantities. Implement business rule validation: prevent transfers to same location, check if locations belong to company, validate item existence in source location. Create transfer record with 'pending' status and generate unique transfer ID. Implement proper error handling with specific HTTP status codes (400 for validation errors, 403 for authorization, 404 for not found). Add request logging and audit trail. Return 201 status with transfer ID and status endpoint location. Test with unit tests covering validation scenarios and integration tests for database operations.

## 3. Implement GET Endpoints for Retrieving Stock Transfer Data [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Create GET endpoints for retrieving individual transfer details and listing company transfers with filtering, pagination, and proper data serialization. Include status tracking and transfer history capabilities.
### Details:
Implement GET /api/companies/[id]/stock/transfers/[transferId] endpoint with authentication and company ownership validation. Add response serialization including transfer details, item information, location names, and status history. Implement GET /api/companies/[id]/stock/transfers list endpoint with query parameters: status filter, date range, pagination (limit/offset), sorting options. Add response caching using Redis with 5-minute TTL for completed transfers. Implement proper error handling for not found transfers and unauthorized access. Include related data using database joins or eager loading to minimize N+1 queries. Add response compression for large datasets. Test with various filter combinations, pagination edge cases, and performance testing for large datasets.

## 4. Implement Transaction Management and Database Consistency [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Create robust transaction management system to ensure data consistency during stock transfers, including database transactions, optimistic locking, and rollback mechanisms for handling concurrent operations and system failures.
### Details:
Implement database transaction wrapper using ACID properties with proper isolation levels (READ_COMMITTED or SERIALIZABLE). Create transaction service class with methods: beginTransaction(), commitTransaction(), rollbackTransaction(). Implement optimistic locking using version fields on inventory records to prevent race conditions. Add retry logic with exponential backoff for deadlock scenarios. Create transaction logging for audit purposes and debugging. Implement compensation patterns for complex multi-step operations. Add database connection pooling configuration for handling concurrent requests. Create transaction timeout settings (30 seconds default). Implement proper error handling with transaction rollback on any failure. Test with concurrent request simulation, database failure scenarios, and transaction rollback verification.

## 5. Implement Stock Quantity Validation and Availability Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.4
### Description: Create comprehensive validation system to prevent transfers exceeding available quantities, including real-time inventory checks, reserved quantity handling, and multi-item transfer validation with proper error reporting.
### Details:
Implement inventory availability service with methods: checkAvailability(), reserveQuantity(), releaseReservation(). Create real-time stock level queries with consideration for pending transfers and reservations. Implement batch validation for multi-item transfers with atomic success/failure. Add reserved quantity tracking to prevent overselling during pending transfers. Create validation rules: minimum stock levels, maximum transfer quantities, location-specific restrictions. Implement inventory snapshot mechanism for consistent validation across transaction lifecycle. Add detailed error messages specifying which items have insufficient stock and available quantities. Create inventory adjustment logging for audit trails. Implement cache invalidation for inventory levels after transfers. Test with edge cases: zero stock, exact quantity matches, concurrent reservations, and bulk transfer scenarios.

## 6. Implement PUT Approval Endpoint with Inventory Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5
### Description: Create the PUT /api/companies/[id]/stock/transfers/[transferId]/approve endpoint that executes the actual inventory movement, updates stock quantities in both locations, and handles the complete transfer workflow with proper error handling and rollback capabilities.
### Details:
Implement PUT approval endpoint with enhanced authorization (require 'transfer_approver' role, prevent self-approval). Add pre-approval validation: verify transfer status is 'pending', re-validate stock availability, check approval permissions. Implement atomic inventory update operation within database transaction: decrement source location quantities, increment destination location quantities, update transfer status to 'approved', record approval timestamp and approver ID. Add inventory movement logging with before/after quantities for audit trail. Implement rollback mechanism if any step fails during approval process. Add notification system for transfer completion (email/webhook). Create inventory reconciliation checks post-transfer. Implement idempotency to prevent duplicate approvals. Add comprehensive error handling with specific failure reasons. Test with approval workflow scenarios, insufficient stock during approval, concurrent approval attempts, and system failure during inventory updates.
